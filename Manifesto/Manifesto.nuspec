	<description>Manifesto allows developers to quickly and easily create file manifests that can be consumed programmatically.

The created manifests contain basic information about the included files.  The only required data for a file is its name, though optionally,  a hash of the file (using any of the supported HashAlgorithms in the framework) and/or a network location where the file can obtained can be included as well.</description>
